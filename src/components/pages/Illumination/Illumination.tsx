      <p>
        In computer graphics, light usually consists of multiple components. The
        overall effect of a light source on an object is determined by the
        combination of the object's interactions with these components.The three
        primary lighting components (and subsequent interaction types) are
        diffuse, ambient, and specular.

      <h2>Shadows</h2>
      <p>
        Shadows are created by testing whether a pixel is visible from the light
        source, by comparing the pixel to a z-buffer or depth image of the light
        source's view, stored in the form of a texture.
