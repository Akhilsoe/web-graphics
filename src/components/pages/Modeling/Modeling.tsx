      <h2>Sweep Representation</h2>
      <p>
        Sweep representation is simply turning a 2D object to a 3D object by by
        sweeping a 2D object over a path. For example, a 2D rectangle moved in a
        linear path results in the formation of cuboid. To get a better overview
        of what sweep representation is, lets check the demo below. You can see
        a small ring but when you sweep it in a circular path using the slider,
        it leads to the formation of toroid shape. Similarly, we can form
        cylinder using translational sweep of a circle, prism using a
        translational sweep of a triangle.

      <h2>Constructive Solid Geometry</h2>
      <p>
        Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface
        or object by using Boolean operators to combine simpler objects,
        potentially generating visually complex objects by combining a few
        primitive ones. In 3D computer graphics and CAD, CSG is often used in
        procedural modeling. CSG can also be performed on polygonal meshes, and
        may or may not be procedural and/or parametric An object is constructed
        from primitives by means of allowable operations, which are typically
        Boolean operations on sets: union, intersection and difference, as well
        as geometric transformations of those sets. Here, in the demo given
        below, change the primitive meshes and the CSG operation and analyse
        yourself the changes in the output structure.
